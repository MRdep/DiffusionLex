## DiffusionLex (The Diffusion MRI lexicon)

## Overview 
The ISMRM Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI) has developed a lexicon for contrast-agent perfusion MRI (CAPLEX). CAPLEX was first developed using googledocs, but has now been migrated to a webpage hosted by github pages (https://osipi.github.io/OSIPI_CAPLEX/). The aim of CAPLEX was to reduce variability in the way people refer to quantities, models, or analysis processes. Through this effort, a general framework has been developed for lexiconography applied to MRI data. This website hosts an extension of the OSIPI CAPLEX to diffusion MRI.
